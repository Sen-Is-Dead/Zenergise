# Project Submission Overview

This document serves as a guide to the files included in this submission and instructions on how to set up and run the project. The project is built using Django for the backend and React Native for the frontend, offering a comprehensive platform for fitness and nutrition tracking.

## Files Included

### Backend Files
- `models.py` - Contains the Django models for the application, defining the database schema.
- `serializers.py` - Includes Django REST Framework serializers for data serialization and deserialization.
- `views.py` - Provides the views for handling requests to the backend API.
- `urls.py` - Manages the routing of API endpoints.
- `validations.py` - Contains custom validation functions for request data.
- `requirements.txt` - Lists all Python dependencies needed for the backend.

### Frontend Files
- `index.js`, `login.js`, `profile.js`, `home.js`, `nutrition.js`, `addFoodModal.js` - React Native components for different screens of the application.
- `Styles/` - Contains styling files for the React Native components.
- `assets/` - Includes images and icons used in the app.

### Executable File
Due to the nature of the project, an executable file is not provided. This project consists of a backend Django application and a frontend React Native application, both of which need to be set up and run in a development environment.

## Setup and Running Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. **Install Python and pip**
   - Ensure Python and pip are installed on your machine. Python 3.8 or higher is recommended.
2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
3. **Apply Migrations**
   - Set up the database by applying migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
4. **Run the Server**
   - Start the Django development server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

### Frontend Setup
1. **Set Up React Native Environment**
   - Follow the React Native CLI Quickstart guide on React Native Environment Setup to prepare your environment.
2. **Install Node Modules**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
3. **Run the App**
   - Start the app using Expo CLI:
     ```bash
     expo start
     ```
   - This will open a browser tab where you can run the app on iOS, Android, or web.

## Usage

Once both servers are running, you can use the app to register, log in, and use the features such as workout planning and nutrition tracking.

## Troubleshooting

- **Backend Issues:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and the database is properly set up with migrations applied.
- **Frontend Issues:** Confirm your environment setup matches the requirements for React Native development.

For further assistance, refer to the official Django and React Native documentation or the specific error messages you encounter.
